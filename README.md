Client setup:

In the terminal, run the command 'npm install' to install necessary dependencies.

Once the packages finish installing run the command, 'npm start'.

This should open your browser and direct you to 'localhost:3000'.

If running npm start does not open your browser and go to the site automatically, enter the url: 'localhost:3000'.

The client end should now be operational.
